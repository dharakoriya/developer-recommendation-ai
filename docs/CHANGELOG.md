# Changelog

All meaningful project changes should be recorded here.

## Format

Each entry should contain:

* Version/date
* Change
* Reason
* Important technical decision

## 2026-08-10 — Project Foundation

### Added

* Initial project documentation structure.
* Defined project rules.
* Defined technology stack.
* Defined system architecture.
* Defined initial database design.
* Defined REST API structure.
* Defined feature scope.
* Defined ML architecture.
* Defined development roadmap.

### Technology Decisions

Frontend:

* Next.js
* TypeScript

Backend:

* FastAPI
* Python

Database:

* PostgreSQL

ML:

* scikit-learn
* XGBoost

Explainability:

* SHAP

### Architecture Decision

The system will use a modular monolithic architecture.

The ML engine will remain part of the application backend ecosystem rather than being developed as a separate application.

### Scope Decision

The initial implementation will prioritize:

* Authentication
* Developer management
* Task management
* Dashboard
* ML recommendation
* SHAP explanation
* Workload balancing

The following are intentionally excluded from the initial implementation:

* LLM chatbot
* Autonomous AI agents
* Neural networks
* Real-time model retraining
* Complex MLOps
* Microservices
* Kubernetes
* Paid AI APIs

### Cost Decision

The development stack will use open-source technologies wherever practical.

Target software/development cost:

₹0 before deployment.

## 2026-08-11 — Milestone 1 — Project Initialization

### Added

* Initialized Next.js (App Router, React 18, TypeScript) frontend under `/frontend`.
* Initialized FastAPI (Python 3.12, Uvicorn, Pydantic v2) backend under `/backend`.
* Implemented `GET /api/health` REST endpoint returning backend operational status and database connection state.
* Configured SQLAlchemy PostgreSQL database connection logic with environment variable loading via `pydantic-settings`.
* Created environment template files (`.env.example` & `.env.local`) for frontend and backend.
* Implemented dark theme system verification page in Next.js to verify frontend-backend REST communication.
* Created root `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets, virtual environments, build artifacts, and node_modules.

### Technical Decisions

* Frontend-Backend Communication: Configured CORS middleware on FastAPI allowing requests from Next.js (`http://localhost:3000`).
* Environment Management: Separated secret handling into `.env` files with strict `.env.example` templates; no hardcoded credentials in source code.
